# TradingAgents Prompt Reference

Verbatim prompt extractions from the TradingAgents multi-agent trading framework. These prompts are the core IP of the system — each agent role has a carefully crafted prompt that defines its behavior in the pipeline.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Analysts (parallel) → Research Debate (sequential) → Decision → Risk Debate (sequential) → Final Decision
```

> Note: "Decision" here = Research Manager + Trader; see SKILL.md §3 for the full 6-stage flow.

## Stage Details

### Analyst Stage (parallel)
- **Market Analyst**: Technical analysis using up to 8 complementary indicators (SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger, ATR, VWMA, MFI)
- **Sentiment Analyst**: Multi-source sentiment (Yahoo Finance news + StockTwits + Reddit) with structured output
- **News Analyst**: Macro/news research using FRED data, prediction markets, and global news
- **Fundamentals Analyst**: Financial statements, balance sheet, cash flow, income statement analysis
- **China Market Analyst** (CN): A-share/HK-specific analysis (Tushare referenced in the verbatim prompt but not wired — the trad-skill binary uses Eastmoney), T+1 rules, price limits
- **CN News Analyst** (CN): Chinese financial news analysis with timeliness and impact assessment
- **Fund Market Analyst** (fund): NAV-based market analysis for A-share funds (公募基金/ETF/LOF), covering unit/cumulative NAV trends, NAV growth volatility, benchmark-relative performance (沪深300), drawdowns, and scale effects. Data source: `trad-skill fund`.
- **Fund Sentiment Analyst** (fund): Fund-specific sentiment from 申购/赎回 status (SGZT/SHZT), institutional holdings changes, and holder sentiment inferred from subscription/redemption limits. Data source: `trad-skill fund`.
- **Fund News Analyst** (fund): Fund news research by fund name via web-search (fund codes collide with stock codes, so `trad-skill news` is ETF-only and optional). Data source: web-search.
- **Fund Fundamentals Analyst** (fund): Fund profile and holdings analysis (基金全称/类型/规模/经理/管理人/托管人, top-10 重仓股, 业绩表现), replacing company financial statements. Data source: `trad-skill fund`.

### Research Debate (sequential, multi-round)
- **Bull Researcher**: Advocates for investing, counters bear arguments
- **Bear Researcher**: Argues against investing, highlights risks and weaknesses

### Decision
- **Research Manager**: Evaluates debate, produces investment plan with Buy/Overweight/Hold/Underweight/Sell rating
- **Trader**: Converts investment plan into concrete transaction proposal

### Risk Debate (sequential, multi-round)
- **Aggressive Risk Analyst**: Champions high-reward strategies, challenges caution
- **Conservative Risk Analyst**: Prioritizes asset protection and stability
- **Neutral Risk Analyst**: Balanced perspective, advocates moderate strategy

### Final Decision
- **Portfolio Manager**: Synthesizes risk debate, delivers final trading decision

## Template Variable Substitution

The verbatim role prompts contain LangChain-style template variables (`{ticker}`, `{current_date}`, `{instrument_context}`, `{get_language_instruction()}`, etc.) that the original TradingAgents framework substituted at runtime via LangChain prompt partials. **This skill does not use LangChain** — the main agent must substitute these variables **before** spawning each sub-agent, otherwise the sub-agent receives literal `{...}` strings in its prompt.

The table below defines the substitution for every variable found across `references/prompts/*.md` (30 unique variables). The main agent should apply these when constructing each spawn prompt (see SKILL.md §4 spawn template).

> **Note on phantom variables (R6-12).** Of these 30, three — `{current_date}`, `{tool_names}`, `{system_message}` — appear only in the source repo's outer `ChatPromptTemplate` wrapper, **not** in the extracted `system_message` bodies of trad-skill's prompt files. Their substitution is a no-op at the prompt-body level, but they are documented in the table below for completeness (the source repo's outer template used them; trad-skill inlines the role prompt directly). Additionally, six prompt files' front-matter "Template variables" lines previously listed these phantom variables — that was fixed in round 6 (R6-4) to only list variables that actually appear in the body.

### Identity & labels

| Variable | Substitute with |
|---|---|
| `{ticker}` | The ticker symbol (e.g. `AAPL`, `600519`, `0700.HK`, `BTC-USD`). |
| `{target_label}` | The literal word `stock` for equities (US/CN/HK) or `asset` for crypto (`-USD` tickers). Used in bull/bear prompts as the debate subject noun (e.g. "advocating for investing in the {target_label}" → "advocating for investing in the stock"). Matches source `bull_researcher.py:20` / `bear_researcher.py:24`. |
| `{asset_label}` | The literal word `company` for equities or `asset` for crypto. Used in `news_analyst.md` (e.g. "for {asset_label}-specific news" → "for company-specific news"). Matches source `news_analyst.py:17`. |
| `{company_name}` | The company name if known from `trad-skill fundamentals` profile (`longName`); otherwise the ticker. |
| `{fundamentals_label}` | The full label string `Company fundamentals report` for equities, or `Asset fundamentals report (may be unavailable for crypto)` for crypto. Used as a section header in bull/bear prompts (e.g. "{fundamentals_label}: {fundamentals_report}"). Matches source `bull_researcher.py:22-25` / `bear_researcher.py:26-29`. |

> For funds: `{target_label}` = `fund`, `{asset_label}` = `fund`, `{fundamentals_label}` = `Fund fundamentals report`, `{instrument_context}` = `Market: A股基金; Ticker: <code>; Trade date: <date>`.

### Dates

| Variable | Substitute with |
|---|---|
| `{current_date}` | Today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (the trade date). |
| `{start_date}` | Analysis window start (default: today − 365 days; see SKILL.md §6). |
| `{end_date}` | Analysis window end (default: today). |

### Context, language & tooling

| Variable | Substitute with |
|---|---|
| `{instrument_context}` | A one-line market context: `Market: <US / A股 / 港股 / Crypto>; Ticker: <symbol>; Trade date: <YYYY-MM-DD>` (and company name if known). |
| `{get_language_instruction()}` | English (default): **empty string** (no instruction injected — matches source `agent_utils.py:52-65`). Non-English: ` Write your entire response in <lang>.` (note the leading space, matching source). trad-skill does **not** inject any "Respond in English" string when the language is English, to stay verbatim-faithful to the source behavior. |
| `{tool_names}` | Empty string, or the data-fetch command assigned to the analyst (e.g. `trad-skill stock --symbol <ticker>`). The data command is the only tool. |
| `{system_message}` | Empty string (no separate system message; the role prompt itself is the system message). |
| `{NO_EXTERNAL_TOOLS}` | Empty string — **not** set. The spawn template permits web-search / browser fallback when a data command fails or returns no data. (Setting it would conflict with the fallback policy.) |
| `{lessons_line}` | Empty string (this skill does not maintain a lessons-learned line between runs). |

> **Note on `{instrument_context}` (R6-11).** trad-skill uses a compact one-line market context for token efficiency. The source repo's `build_instrument_context` (`agent_utils.py:122-169`) produces a fuller paragraph that emphasizes ticker preservation and identity anchoring (anti-hallucination wording added in source #814). trad-skill intentionally drops this anti-hallucination wording to save tokens; agents should rely on SKILL.md §2 (confirm the ticker first) as the anti-hallucination gate. If you observe ticker/company confusion in analyst output, consider expanding `{instrument_context}` to include the source's full paragraph.

> **Note on whitespace before `{get_language_instruction()}` (R6-24).** trad-skill normalizes the whitespace immediately before `{get_language_instruction()}` to a single blank line for readability. The source repo concatenates `+ get_language_instruction()` directly after the prompt string (no blank line). When English (empty substitution), this results in a trailing blank line in trad-skill vs. no trailing blank line in source — cosmetically different but semantically identical. For non-English, the blank line + leading space in the substituted string produces clean paragraph separation.

### Data reports (bound to stage outputs)

These variables bind to the outputs of prior pipeline stages. See SKILL.md §4 "Re-injection discipline" for the digest-vs-full-report strategy.

| Variable | Bound to |
|---|---|
| `{market_research_report}` | Market Analyst report. In debate stages (2 & 5): bind to the `## Key Signals` digest only. In Portfolio Manager: bind full report. |
| `{sentiment_report}` | Sentiment Analyst report (same digest/full rule). |
| `{news_report}` | News Analyst report (same digest/full rule). |
| `{fundamentals_report}` | Fundamentals Analyst report (same digest/full rule). |
| `{history}` | The running debate transcript (paragraph-sized, not full reports). |
| `{investment_plan}` | Research Manager output → Trader input. (Risk Debate does NOT receive `{investment_plan}` — it receives `{trader_decision}`/`{trader_plan}` per the row below.) |
| `{trader_decision}` / `{trader_plan}` | Trader output → Risk Debate input + Portfolio Manager input. |
| `{research_plan}` | Research Manager output → Portfolio Manager input. |
| `{current_response}` | The previous bull/bear argument in the current Research Debate round. |
| `{current_aggressive_response}` | The previous Aggressive Risk argument in the current Risk Debate round. |
| `{current_conservative_response}` | The previous Conservative Risk argument in the current Risk Debate round. |
| `{current_neutral_response}` | The previous Neutral Risk argument in the current Risk Debate round. |

### Pre-fetched data blocks (Sentiment Analyst only)

The `sentiment_analyst.md` prompt expects three pre-fetched data blocks. The original framework fetched these before invoking the LLM; this skill fetches them via `trad-skill sentiment` at spawn time.

| Variable | Substitute with |
|---|---|
| `{stocktwits_block}` | The StockTwits section of `trad-skill sentiment` output (US market). For CN market, use the 东方财富 个股评论 section (semantic equivalent: retail social sentiment). |
| `{reddit_block}` | The Reddit section of `trad-skill sentiment` output (US market). For CN market, use the 东方财富 机构参与度 section (semantic equivalent: institutional flow signal). |
| `{news_block}` | **Not provided by `trad-skill sentiment`.** The sentiment command covers social signals only. If the Sentiment Analyst needs news context for cross-source divergence analysis, it should use web-search fallback, or leave the block empty and note "news block not pre-fetched — see News Analyst report". The News Analyst separately covers news in Stage 1. |

## Tool-Name Override

Some verbatim prompts instruct the agent to call tools like `get_stock_data`, `get_news`, `get_fundamentals`, etc. **These tools do not exist in this skill** — the verbatim text is preserved per the AGENTS.md "never paraphrase" rule, but the actual data source is the `trad-skill` binary (see SKILL.md §6 for the full command reference). SKILL.md §4 overrides these references at spawn time.

### Market Analyst tools (`market_analyst.md` / `china_market_analyst.md`)

> Note: Only `market_analyst.md` references these ghost tools. The CN counterpart `china_market_analyst.md` does NOT reference any `get_*` tools (verified by grep) — it describes its data source inline (东方财富行情), so the override below applies to the EN prompt only.

- `get_stock_data` / `get_indicators` / `get_verified_market_snapshot` → `trad-skill stock --symbol <ticker> [--start <s>] [--end <e>] [--tail <n>] [--stats]`
- The command output is the "verified snapshot" — it already pre-computes indicators (see `indicators.md`).
- The analyst must run the data command before writing its report; web search / browser tools are a fallback only for parts the command could not provide.

### News Analyst tools (`news_analyst.md` / `cn_news_analyst.md`)

> Note: Only `news_analyst.md` references these ghost tools. The CN counterpart `cn_news_analyst.md` does NOT reference any `get_*` tools (verified by grep) — it describes its data source inline (东方财富新闻 / Google News), so the override below applies to the EN prompt only.

- `get_news(ticker, start_date, end_date)` → `trad-skill news --symbol <ticker> --days 7 --limit 8`
- `get_global_news(curr_date, look_back_days, limit)` → no separate command; the same `trad-skill news` output includes macro headlines where available. Use web-search fallback for broader macro context.
- `get_macro_indicators(indicator, curr_date, look_back_days)` → **no command** (FRED not wired). Use web-search fallback.
- `get_prediction_markets(topic, limit)` → **no command** (Polymarket not wired). Use web-search fallback.

### Fundamentals Analyst tools (`fundamentals_analyst.md`)

- `get_fundamentals` → `trad-skill fundamentals --symbol <ticker>`
- `get_balance_sheet` / `get_cashflow` / `get_income_statement` → **no separate command**. These statements are already distilled into the compact key-metrics table (revenue, net income, EPS, total assets, total debt, operating cash flow, free cash flow) by `trad-skill fundamentals`. If the analyst needs full statement detail, use web-search fallback.

### Sentiment Analyst tools (`sentiment_analyst.md`)

- The verbatim prompt expects pre-fetched `{news_block}` / `{stocktwits_block}` / `{reddit_block}` data blocks (see "Template Variable Substitution" above). The data source is `trad-skill sentiment --symbol <ticker> --limit 15`; the command output fills the StockTwits and Reddit blocks. The news block is not provided by the sentiment command (the News Analyst separately covers news).

### Fund Analyst tools (`fund_market_analyst.md` / `fund_sentiment_analyst.md` / `fund_news_analyst.md` / `fund_fundamentals_analyst.md`)

- The fund prompt files describe their data sources inline and reference no `get_*` ghost tools. Data source: `trad-skill fund --symbol <ticker>` (market / sentiment / fundamentals analysts).
- Fund News Analyst: web-search by fund name is the primary source. `trad-skill news --symbol <ticker>` fetches stock news and would hit the wrong asset for a 6-digit fund code that collides with a stock code (e.g. 000001); it may return usable news for ETFs only, and the prompt itself qualifies that exception.

Do not modify the verbatim prompt files. The overrides live in `SKILL.md` §4, `indicators.md`, and the table below.
