# Technical Indicators Reference

Indicators available to the Market Analyst, organized by category.
The Market Analyst selects up to 8 complementary indicators per analysis.

> **These indicators are pre-computed by the script.** Run `python "<skill>/scripts/fetch_stock_data.py" --symbol <ticker> --start <s> --end <e>` and the output already contains a compact indicator snapshot (latest values + trend signals). The Market Analyst **interprets** these pre-computed values — it does not call a separate tool or recompute them by hand. There is no `get_stock_data` / `get_indicators` tool; the python script is the data source.

## Selection Guidelines
- Select indicators that provide diverse and complementary information
- Avoid redundancy (e.g., do not select both RSI and StochRSI)
- Explain why each indicator is suitable for the given market context
- The script fetches the OHLCV and computes the indicators in one call

## Moving Averages

### close_50_sma — 50 SMA
A medium-term trend indicator.
- **Usage**: Identify trend direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance.
- **Tips**: It lags price; combine with faster indicators for timely signals.

### close_200_sma — 200 SMA
A long-term trend benchmark.
- **Usage**: Confirm overall market trend and identify golden/death cross setups.
- **Tips**: It reacts slowly; best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.

### close_10_ema — 10 EMA
A responsive short-term average.
- **Usage**: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points.
- **Tips**: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.

## MACD Related

### macd — MACD
Computes momentum via differences of EMAs.
- **Usage**: Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes.
- **Tips**: Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.

### macds — MACD Signal
An EMA smoothing of the MACD line.
- **Usage**: Use crossovers with the MACD line to trigger trades.
- **Tips**: Should be part of a broader strategy to avoid false positives.

### macdh — MACD Histogram
Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal.
- **Usage**: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early.
- **Tips**: Can be volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.

## Momentum Indicators

### rsi — RSI
Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions.
- **Usage**: Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals.
- **Tips**: In strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.

## Volatility Indicators

### boll — Bollinger Middle
A 20 SMA serving as the basis for Bollinger Bands.
- **Usage**: Acts as a dynamic benchmark for price movement.
- **Tips**: Combine with the upper and lower bands to effectively spot breakouts or reversals.

### boll_ub — Bollinger Upper Band
Typically 2 standard deviations above the middle line.
- **Usage**: Signals potential overbought conditions and breakout zones.
- **Tips**: Confirm signals with other tools; prices may ride the band in strong trends.

### boll_lb — Bollinger Lower Band
Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle line.
- **Usage**: Indicates potential oversold conditions.
- **Tips**: Use additional analysis to avoid false reversal signals.

### atr — ATR
Averages true range to measure volatility.
- **Usage**: Set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility.
- **Tips**: It's a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.

## Volume-Based Indicators

### vwma — VWMA
A moving average weighted by volume.
- **Usage**: Confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data.
- **Tips**: Watch for skewed results from volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses.

### mfi — MFI (Money Flow Index)
A momentum indicator that uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure.
- **Usage**: Identify overbought (>80) or oversold (<20) conditions and confirm the strength of trends or reversals.
- **Tips**: Use alongside RSI or MACD to confirm signals; divergence between price and MFI can indicate potential reversals.

## Verified Market Snapshot

The `fetch_stock_data.py` script output is the source of truth for any exact OHLCV, price-level, or indicator-value claim. If a web-search fallback conflicts with the script output, flag the discrepancy rather than inventing a reconciled number. Do not claim historical validation, support/resistance bounces, or exact percentage moves unless they are directly supported by the script output with concrete dates and prices.
